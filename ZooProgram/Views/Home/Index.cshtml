        <h2>Pet Animals</h2>
        <p>
            A pet, or companion animal, is an animal kept primarily for a person's company or entertainment rather than as a working animal,
            livestock or a laboratory animal. Popular pets are often considered to have attractive appearances, intelligence and relatable personalities,
            but some pets may be taken in on an altruistic basis (such as a stray animal) and accepted by the owner regardless of these characteristics.

            Two of the most popular pets are dogs and cats; the technical term for a cat lover is an ailurophile and a dog lover a cynophile.

        <h2>Wild Animals</h2>
        <p>Wildlife traditionally refers to undomesticated animal species, but has come to include all organisms that grow or live wild in an 
        area without being introduced by humans.[1] Wildlife can be found in all ecosystems. 
        Deserts, forests, rainforests, plains, grasslands, and other areas, including the most developed urban areas, 
        all have distinct forms of wildlife. While the term in popular culture usually refers to animals that are untouched by human factors, 
        most scientists agree that much wildlife is affected by human activities.[2]</p>

        <h2>Aquatic Animals</h2>
        <p>An aquatic animal is an animal, either vertebrate or invertebrate, which lives in the water for most or all of its lifetime.[1] Many insects such as mosquitoes, mayflies, dragonflies and caddisflies have aquatic larvae, with winged adults. Aquatic animals may breathe air or extract oxygen that dissolved in water through specialised organs called gills, or directly through the skin. Natural environments and the animals that live in them can be categorized as aquatic (water) or terrestrial (land). This designation is paraphyletic.</p>
